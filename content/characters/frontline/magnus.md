## Dossier

**SKILLS:** Captivating any audience.

**KNOWN FOR:** Being EvoS' CEO.

**BIGGEST DREAM:** He's already living it!

## Story

**Story:**

Oceanus, the now-fallen megacity, was once home to billions of genetically modified marvels, all loosely allied in the advancement of science and evolutionary variety. According to legend, a young Magnus Pretorius was the first to successfully advocate for stronger leadership, corralling thousands of diverse communities together to form Oceanus' first centralized government. His dedication to city unification was Oceanus' salvation when its Reactor failed, and under his leadership, they secured a new seat of power in Atlas as "Evolution Solutions."

As CEO of EvoS, Magnus earned a reputation as a strict, yet adaptable, leader. As comfortable as he is delegating tasks to others, he's also more than willing to take matters into his own, highly armored hands â€“ evidenced now by his entry into Freelancing, despite a lack of financial or resurrectional need.

"I do what I want," Magnus said, to reporters at HNN when asked about the freelancing bid. "The more interesting question is, does anyone have the bones to stop me?"
