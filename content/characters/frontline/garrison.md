## Dossier

**SKILLS:** Fighting. Talking about fighting.

**KNOWN FOR:** War-time heroics. Peace-time chaos.

**HOBBIES:** Bare-knuckle boxing. Pub-crawling.

"Who's pummeled to pulp our dread enemies? It's our Garrison: the one man army!" Drinking songs of Garrison's war heroics abound, born, like him, in fields of bullets, bombs, and bots. According to legend, when injuries from an arms deal gone sideways nearly ended Garrison’s life, he crawled into a Warbotics Ballistic Exo Suit to survive. Not only did he survive, many say that the campaign of vengeance that followed won the war for the Trusts altogether. To honor his bravery and skill, his was the first resurrection contract sponsored by Warbotics.

A more honest man has never lived. Especially with a drink in his hand. Talk to him after a match, and he'll foot the bill on a good brew afterward. Even if he knocks you off your feet, you can still do a pub crawl, right?
