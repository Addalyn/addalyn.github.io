## Dossier

**SKILLS:** Shielding allies. Shielding enemies (to the face).

**KNOWN FOR:** Being the last known descendant of Hyperion royalty.

**FAVORITE SAYING:** “Justice has wings.”

It is said that of the great warrior dynasties that once reigned in Hyperion, Brynn’s was the finest. Her ancestry was full of generals, commanders, and lords who ruled over the city with a radamantium fist. When the Hyperion Reactor fell in 2435, her people guided thousands across the Waste to Atlas and helped establish the new Trust rule by forming Warbotics.

Some suggest that Brynn’s latest foray into Freelancing may be related to the dissolution of Warbotics after their defeat in the Trust War. Family pride and loyalty run deep in her history. And, as any descendant of Hyperion knows, wars don’t end until the blood runs dry.

## Story

**Friends:**

- **Rampart:** Any friend of Hyperion is a friend of hers.

**Rivals:**

- None listed.
