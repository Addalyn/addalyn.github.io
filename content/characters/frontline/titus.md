## Dossier

**SKILLS:** Slaying monsters for fun (and profit).

**KNOWN FOR:** Sole survivor of a massacre in the Waste… that he started.

**FAVORITE SAYING:** "I'll forgive you. My blade won't."

## Story

Despite the rumors, there is life in the Waste. If you’ve never seen it, it’s because Titus got there first. The nomadic warrior's reputation is well-known by all those who sought refuge in Atlas as the other reactors failed. The many beasts he obliterated along the road allowed thousands of travelers to reach the megacity. While his actions benefited thousands, many doubt his motivations were altruistic.

His supernatural strength and shouts can root enemies in fear, tear apart his surroundings, and cause severe tinnitus. (That last part is probably why he is a lone wolf.)

## Friends:

- **Garrison:** Often found exchanging combat stories in the pub.

## Rivals:

None
