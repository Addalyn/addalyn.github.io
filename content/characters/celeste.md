## Dossier

**SKILLS:** Misdirection. Safecracking.

**KNOWN FOR:** Acquiring rare items by request for a small fee.

**PREFERRED HAIR PRODUCT:** Getting 'Air, same as Lockwood.

New records indicate that Celeste's unusual freelancing contract was sponsored with a generous donation from HelioCorp. Early investigations indicate that the two may have met earlier this year, when several of Cloudspire's automatic security wards reported that they'd been attacked at range or had their vision compromised by persistent smoke, which falls in line with her current Freelancing profile.

Celeste claims to have infiltrated Omni Trust, Evolution Solutions, and Warbotics. She's made numerous confidential Omni records public, and many suspect she has intel on EvoS and Warbotics as well.
