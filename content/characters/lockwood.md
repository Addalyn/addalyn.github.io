## Dossier

**SKILLS:** Quick draw, escape.

**KNOWN FOR:** Heists and hair products. Always shoots first.

**IMPLANTS:** Agility, charm (recalled).

War deserter. Rebel arms dealer. Scoundrel. Lockwood's truncated war record shows that he fought in Garrison's regiment shortly before vanishing into black market gun running. Even if Lockwood's status as Atlas' first Freelancer has afforded him newfound legitimacy, his slippery tactics are well documented. Historical, even. DNA analysis indicates that he may have resurrected in the Reactor's earliest cycles.

Stay on your guard and remember: Lockwood's always looking to shoot you in the back, even when he's smirking in your face.
