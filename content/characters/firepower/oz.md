## Dossier

**SKILLS:** Light painting and laser shows.

**KNOWN FOR:** Surviving the “Jimmy 6 and his Magic Tricks” toy recall.

**HOBBIES:** Guerilla artwork, AI activism.

## Story

Jimmy 6 and His Magic Tricks was slated to be Toybotics' next best-selling toy. An AI malfunction made it one of their biggest failures instead. Customers were displeased with the toy's surprise magic trick of free will and weaponized lasers. Only one toy escaped the subsequent recall: Oz. Sources within Toybotics say that his recall chip was damaged during reclamation, allowing him to escape the recycler.

Oz's demonstrations of free will sparked outrage among AI-rights groups who demanded that Oz be spared from the recall. Toybotics’ parent company, Warbotics, then sponsored Oz as an official Freelancer and enhanced his magic tricks with matter-dissolving lasers. No matter his origins, Oz isn't toying around anymore.
