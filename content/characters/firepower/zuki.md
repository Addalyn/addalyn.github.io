## Dossier

**SKILLS:** Making things, blowing them up.

**KNOWN FOR:** Explosive entrances, exits.

**PROUDEST MOMENT:** Programming PuP to drop beats on command.

Zuki is an off-the-books modder and machinist – one of the few people left in the world who knows what welding is, much less how to do it. Records show she was born in Atlas, and was curiously left in the care of Lockwood after the disappearance of her father. She discovered her unique aptitude with all things explosive after combusting Lockwood's hovercraft using nothing but an e-cigar, an old boot, and a coat hanger.

She is often found piloting her flying junkyard around central Atlas alongside fellow Freelancer, PuP.

## Story

**Friends:**

- **Lockwood:** Makes a gift for Lockwood every Reactor Day.
- **PuP:** Rarely seen without each other.
- **Helio:** Childhood friends.
- **Garrison:** Garrison’s a regular customer at Zuki's Junkyard.
