## Dossier

**SKILLS:** Merciless revenge against those who stabbed him in the back. Or hearth.

**KNOWN FOR:** Being one of the first androids GAIA ever created.

**FUN FACT:** Tol-Ren was clinically dead for over 1,576,800 minutes! Not a world record, but impressive all the same.

## Story

**Friends:**

- **Su-Ren:** From scribbles on the Omni whiteboard: “Su & Tol sitting in a tree, s-p-a-r-k-i-n-g.”

**Rivals:**

- **Kaigin:** Documents suggest the two may be enemies. Their repeated attempts to kill each other suggest that too.
