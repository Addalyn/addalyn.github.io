## Dossier

**SKILLS:** Sniping and stealth.

**KNOWN FOR:** Not being seen or heard. He may not exist at all.

**PET PEEVES:** Tall people. Tall robots. Tall things.

## Story

Wherever Evolution Solutions' lead sniper goes, silence follows. Not much is known about the sniper's origins at EvoS (and even less is known now that he's been made head of their security). Legend has it that the only way to find his offices is to follow the chill down your spine. While no regular EvoS employees have ever seen Nix in person, sources from within the Trust are still fairly certain that he does, in fact, exist.

With his specialized stealth suit and sniper rifle, Nix liberates his targets from the burden of life just before vanishing without a trace. Keep an eye on him if you can, or it might be the last mistake you ever make.

**Friends:**

**Rivals:** Grey - Ongoing competition as to who can kill the most monsters (and each other) first.
