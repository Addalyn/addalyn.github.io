## Dossier

**SKILLS:** Infiltrating enemy lines. Exploding enemy lines.

**KNOWN FOR:** Not quite dying heroically in battle.

**FAVORITE PARTY TRICK:** Materializing grenades and stims out of thin air. (Double on the stims).

Blackburn was once the leader of Warbotics' special ops squad, Ares 1. The elite squad took on missions no one thought possible – and those doubts were proven right. Archival records state that Blackburn's entire unit, including himself, died in a bloody skirmish in the Waste. His emergence now as a mechanized super soldier for Warbotics has many Atlas citizens curious. Given that Blackburn appears to share the memories of the fallen soldier, it does seem that they are one and the same.

Blackburn carries a hi-tech rifle and gauntlet that makes grenades, ammo, and stims on demand. His favorite part is the endless supply of stims. He sure does like his stims.

- **Elle:** Agent L is suspected of [redacted] at the battle for [redacted]. Further investigation required.
