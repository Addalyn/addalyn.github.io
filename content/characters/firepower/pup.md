## Dossier

**SKILLS:** Biting, fetching, high stakes espionage.

**KNOWN FOR:** Burying cash (and Zuki's tools).

**PET PEEVES:** Rust. Oil baths. Mass market PuP-toys.

PuP (Project Universal Protector) is the original prototype for a stealth spy-bot, programmed to infiltrate enemy zones, destroy sentries, and capture targets. While the rest of PuP's line was destroyed after the war due to fears of an AI resurgence, the rebel engineer who created him prevented his recycling. When that man later vanished, Warbotics allowed PuP to be placed in the care of the inventor's daughter, Zuki. Much to PuP's dismay, Toybotics' PuP-inspired toys are the most popular in Atlas.

It may be why he's let Zuki mod his gear so extensively, from upgrading his kit to programming him to drop sick beats on command.

## Story

**Friends:**

- **Zuki:** PuP is most often found gnawing on tools in Zuki's junkyard.

**Rivals:**

- **Celeste:** Documented mistrust. Grrs. Growls. Snarls. You name it.
