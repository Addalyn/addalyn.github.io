## Dossier

**SKILLS:** Reassembling your body parts in new and exciting ways.

**KNOWN FOR:** Heals, zeal, and Reactor-energized eels.

**CHILDHOOD DREAM:** To become a fish! (Only 50% more to go!)

The "Father of Inter-Species Hybridization" often credits his scientific success at EvoS to an insatiable curiosity. Few alive know how insatiable it truly is. When willing subjects of his Reactor-ized fish experiments were finally depleted, he volunteered his own body to science to see his vision through. Other aquatic hybrids in Atlas have expressed a distrust of Dr. Finn, citing suspicions that he only converted for the jokes.

Dr. Finn's eel-energized ray gun is customized to his specifications. It has a thermo-accelerator, a chemical synthesizer, and a matter replicator that provides him with an endless stream of eels (and test subjects).

## Story

**Friends:**

- **Rask:** Dr. Finn often takes lunch beside Rask's enclosure. Whether Rask likes that is unknown.

**Rivals:**

- **Grey:** He's been overheard railing against her assassination of his "beloveds".
