## Dossier

**SKILLS:** Killing you with kindness (and also a giant hammer).

**KNOWN FOR:** Keeping the Hyperion Stronghold safe for over a century.

**DEEPEST FEARS:** Failing to restore Hyperion. Being melted by his own hammer. Bugs.

## Story

Whispers of the "miracle maker from Hyperion" preceded Meridian's arrival in Atlas. The paint was dry on his new Trust, Hyperbotics before he'd taken one step into the city. Some say he bribed the Trusts with such incredible wealth, they could rebuild all of Atlas in pure radamantium. As of yet, the city's only major change has been the blue rise of Hyperbotics across the skyline, leaving many to wonder how the ancient automaton marshalled such power so quickly.

His presence inspired immediate loyalty from a number of Freelancer - Brynn in particular. He's also been seen frequently at Zuki's Flying Junkyard, which has created much gossip over whether or not he's had any work done. (For the record, when asked, the prideful automaton insists he's 100% original).

**Friends:**

- **Brynn:** It is widely believed that Meridian (repeatedly) saved the lives of Brynn’s forefathers.

**Rivals:**

- **Rampart:** Meridian reportedly called Rampart a “stripped-screwed punk who wouldn’t know a nut from his head,” much to Rampart's delight.
