Support Freelancers use healing, shielding, and damage-mitigating abilities to keep their teammates alive. Often, supports will provide buffs for their teammates and debuffs for the enemy team. On their own, they can still deal a decent amount of damage but generally do less damage than other roles due to the fact that they are assisting their teammates.
