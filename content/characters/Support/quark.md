## Dossier

**SKILLS:** Anything the Reactor does. Just smaller.

**KNOWN FOR:** Gently irradiating your loved ones.

**FAVORITE FOOD:** Brain cells. Yum!

## Story

No Trust has figured out exactly what Quark is (and their curiosity waned after an Omni scientist reportedly vanished in the attempt). Evidence suggests that Quark's powers mimic the Reactor's, repairing or irradiating atoms, though little is known for certain. The Anomaly exploded from the Reactor with all of its parts and most of its mental faculties intact, eager to "tickle neurons" and "murder! Murder EVERYONE!"

Some citizens revere Quark as a prophetic entity, but others are less convinced. After all, it's not that hard to predict someone's impending death when you're the one causing it.

**Friends:**

- **Rask:** Quark likes the taste of Rask's atoms. Also a big fan of Power Juice.
- **Elle:** Quark thinks she's hilarious.

**Trivia:**

- **Voiced By:** [Mara Junot](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm5235708/?ref_=ttfc_fc_cl_t2)
