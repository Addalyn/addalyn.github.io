## Dossier

**SKILLS:** Curing people. Destroying people.

**KNOWN FOR:** Manipulating time, space, and her own DNA.

**WEAPON OF CHOICE:** Razor-sharp condescension.

## Story

Aurora is believed to have been an Omni scientist who vanished while studying the Reactor anomaly, "Quark". After the scientist's disappearance, Aurora emerged from the Reactor, shocking everyone. Literally. Her damage was so thorough, Omni sold out their entire stock of healing catalysts. It is speculated that Aurora has rejoined Omni as a Freelancer to test and strengthen her atomic control over living matter.

Aurora's form mimics the Reactor's abilities, allowing her to mend or destroy atoms at will. How her skills are focused depend entirely on whether she considers those around her to be allies or obstacles.

## Friends

- **Asana:** Often mistaken for each other. Often angry about it.

## Rivals

- **Quark:** Aurora is known to keep tabs (and a narrowed eye) on the oddity's whereabouts.
